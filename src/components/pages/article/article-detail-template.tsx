          In the ever-evolving world of digital product design, collaboration
          between designers and developers has always been a crucial‚Äîyet often
          challenging‚Äîpart of the process. In April 2025, Figma introduced Dev
          Mode, a powerful new feature aimed at streamlining that collaboration
          more than ever before. üîß What Is Dev Mode? Dev Mode is a new
          interface within Figma that provides developer-focused tools and
          removes unnecessary UI clutter that designers typically use. Instead,
          developers can view ready-to-implement specs, such as spacing, color
          values, font styles, and asset exports‚Äîwithout disrupting the design
          file or asking the design team for clarifications. ü§ù Bridging the Gap
          Between Design & Development Traditionally, handing off designs
          involved back-and-forth communication, misunderstandings, and
          occasional delays. With Dev Mode, handoff becomes real-time and
          seamless: Live Design Specs: Developers can inspect the design without
          needing additional tools or extensions. Code Snippets: Automatically
          generated CSS, iOS (Swift), and Android (XML) code help speed up
          implementation. Version History Access: Stay aligned with design
          updates without asking for a new export every time. Integrated
          Comments: Developers can leave feedback directly in the design file.
